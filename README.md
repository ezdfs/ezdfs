## Hi there 👋

## About me🧐😁

🚀 I'm a developer focused in **_perfomance_**. **_minimalism_** and **_productivity_**, specializing in transform limited envirroment into high-perfomances workstations.

⚡ My development approach is based on the total control of the software. If something isn't efficient or fast, I'll make it so.

## Projects 💡
