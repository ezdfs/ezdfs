## Hi there 👋

## About me🧐😁

🚀 I'm a developer focused in **_perfomance_**. **_minimalism_** and **_productivity_**, specializing in transform limited envirroment into high-perfomances workstations.

⚡ My development approach is based on the total control of the software. If something isn't efficient or fast, I'll make it so.

## Projects 💡

- [**Org Microdados ENEM**](https://github.com/ezdfs/org-microdados-enem): Data scraping of the ENEM(National High School Exam). I extracted the questions from pdf and convert it into json and csv files semi automatically.
- [**Questions API**](https://github.com/ezdfs/questoes-api): I'm developing an API to make a entire repository of questions to helps on study using Spring Boot, Docker and MongoDB. Furthermore good use of Hexagonal Architecture and learning a lot.
- [**Autoestudo**](https://github.com/ezdfs/autoestudo): I'm developing an auxiliar application to studies using ReactJS and Rust. Currently, it's break, but I will fix it soon.
- [**MuxVim**](https://github.com/ezdfs/muxvim.git): Neovim configuration and helper setup designed to make Neovim comfortable and productive on mobile devices (phones and tablets).

## Skills 🧠
My main stack is Java with Spring Boot and JS/TS with ReactJS or NextJS. But I also can:

- Develop applications with Python, like API's with Flask, data extraction and in my future plannings: optimizing LLM for differents purposes.
- Develop fullstack apps with JS/TS like ReactJS + Express.js, Nest.js, Fastify, etc.

Currently I'm learning about System Design, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture and Kubernetes. Furthermore I'm also improving about project organization and Docker.

## Future plans 🗺️
I'm interesting in learning Klotin and C#. But for now, it's not my main goal.
